    <h2> Origin </h2> <br>
      <p> Paper mache was first used in 200 AD by the Han Dynasty. Not long after the discovery of paper, the 
        Chinese began using paper mache to create helmets and masks, and cases or boxes. Later on, Egyptians used paper
        mache for tombs as well. During World War I and II, it was used to make dummies to redirect attention, and in 
        fuel tanks for tanks. In more modern times, paper mache is still commonly used for masks and boxes, but also 
        as an art, and for structures. Paper mache is used for sculptures, boats, and in ammunition as a form of bullet 
        casing or shell. Paper mache can be used to decorate items like shields, and can be used with oils to laminate 
        objects. In architecture, paper mache can be used as a replacement for specific wood works. </p> <br>
