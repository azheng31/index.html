          Paper mache, or "mashed paper", was first used in 200 AD by the Han Dynasty. Not long after the discovery of paper, the 
        Chinese began using paper mache to create helmets and masks, and cases or boxes. Later on, Egyptians used paper
        mache for tombs as well. During World War I and II, it was used to make dummies to redirect attention, and in 
        fuel tanks for tanks. In more modern times, paper mache is still commonly used for masks and boxes, but also 
        as an art, and for structures. Paper mache is used for sculptures, boats, and in ammunition as a form of bullet 
        casing or shell. Paper mache can be used to decorate items like shields, and can be used with oils to laminate 
        objects. In architecture, paper mache can be used as a replacement for specific wood works. </p> <br>

    <h2> Materials </h2> <br>
      <p> Paper Mache is normally made through some form of paper, for example many strips of newspaper, or some form of 
        paper pulp mashed together and shaped into the desired form. If one wants to use many strips of paper, it may be
        necessary to get some form of support to form the desired shape. Making a paste of some kind, preferrably out of 
        flour or some kind of starch, and water, is needed. If this cannot be obtained, an adhesive glue can be used. To 
        store this paste, one can use preserving salts or any other preservative. Using an armature, or skeleton, to stabilize 
        the paper can help as well. For pulp, paper is left in water or boiled until the paper becomes a pulpy mixture. Then
        water is drained out, and glue is added. </p> <br>

    <h2> The Basics </h2>
      <p> To get started, it is recommended to cover the workplace with newspaper or some kind of material that can be 
        scrapped or thrown out later. Once the workplace is prepared, one can begin. <br> If you plan to use strips of paper, 
        have your paste nearby. Obtain an item you want to use as a mold. Then, tear or cut paper into thin strips.
        Completely soak these strips in the paste, then lay the strip on your mold. Repeat with multiple strips, covering 
        up more of the mold as you do so. Make sure to have multiple layers of paper around the mold for more stability.
        Once this process is complete, leave the item to dry. It may help to use some sort of stabilizer to hold the item,
        such as wire mesh. Once it is dry, remove it from the mold if necessary. Cutting off a piece of the paper mache may 
        be helpful, this can be reattached later with materials such as glue, or more paper mache. Once that is done, feel 
        free to do as you will with it. A more in-depth tutorial can be found <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Create-Papier-M%C3%A2ch%C3%A9">here</a>. <br>
        If you plan to use paper pulp, obtain an amount of paper, and either allow it to fully soak, or boil it in hot water
        until it's contents become a pulpy mixture. Then, drain the water out of the mixture, and add an adhesive such as glue. 
        once that is done, feel free to shape the pulp int whatever you please, and allow it to dry. A more in-depth tutorial 
        can be found <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Make-paper-mache-pulp/">here</a>. </p>
