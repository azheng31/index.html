      <p> Paper mache was first used in 200 AD by the Han Dynasty. Not long after the discovery of paper, the 
        Chinese began using paper mache to create helmets and masks, and cases or boxes. Later on, Egyptians used paper
        mache for tombs as well. In more modern times, paper mache is still commonly used for masks and boxes, but also 
        for sculptures, boats, architecture, and in ammunition as a form of bullet casing or shell. </p> <br>
